Packaging CalCore
=================
There are two ways of packaging CalCore; Bundleman and setuptools.

Bundleman
---------

This is the primary packaging operation. In most cases you want to run this
before any other type of packaging. "bm-product -- release" will increase the
version number, make a tag in the svn for the new version, make version.txt
and CHANGELOG.txt files and update the CHANGES, HISTORY and VERSION files
accordingly. "bm-product --archive" will create a tgz for the archive.

See http://public.dev.nuxeo.com/~ben/bundleman/

Usage: bm-product --release; bm-product --archive


setuptools
----------
With version 2.0.1 and later, CalCore has eggs. Eggs are a way of distributing
python products as single files, with an install process that keeps track of
and installs requirements. This is the main way of distributing calcore for non
Zope2 use from version 2.0.1.

Usage: python setup.py bdist_egg
