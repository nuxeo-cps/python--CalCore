Packaging CalCore
=================
There are two ways of packaging CalCore; make_pkg and setuptools.

Nuxeo make_pkg
--------------
This is the primary packaging operation. In most cases you want to run this
before any other type of packaging. Nuxeo make_pkg will increase the version
number, make a tag in the svn for the new version, make CHANGES.txt, 
HISTORY.txt and VERSION.txt files, create a tgz package and update the CHANGES,
HISTORY and VERSION files accordingly.

The result is a file, CalCore-x.x.x.tgz that includes the CalCore product.
This can be installed either with distutils or as a Zope 2 Product, although
the installation as a Zope product will be the only supported from versions
after 2.0.1, as 2.0.1 and later has eggs support.

Usage: make_pkg


setuptools
----------
With version 2.0.1 and later, CalCore has eggs. Eggs are a way of distributing
python products as single files, with an install process that keeps track of
and installs requirements. This is the main way of distributing calcore for non
Zope2 use from version 2.0.1.

Usage: python setup.py bdist_egg
