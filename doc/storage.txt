Multiple storage backends

This scenario takes place in the context of multiple storage
backends.

First, we'll create the storage manager::

  >>> from calcore import cal
  >>> m = cal.StorageManager()

Our storage manager needs to have actual storages to work with.
We'll create two, each with a unique name::

  >>> storage1 = cal.MemoryStorage('storage1')
  >>> storage2 = cal.MemoryStorage('storage2')

They need to be added to the manager::

  >>> m.addStorage(storage1)
  >>> m.addStorage(storage2)

The default storage new events will be created in is the first.

Now let's create some people::

  >>> s = cal.SimpleAttendeeSource(m)
  >>> martijn = s.createIndividual('martijn', 'Martijn')
  >>> lennart = s.createIndividual('lennart', 'Lennart')

Martijn creates an event::

   >>> from datetime import datetime, timedelta
   >>> event = martijn.createEvent(
   ...   datetime(2005, 4, 10, 16, 00),
   ...   timedelta(minutes=60),
   ...   title="Martijn's Event")

This should show up in storage1, so let's take a peek::

   >>> april = (datetime(2005, 4, 1), datetime(2005, 5, 1))
   >>> events = storage1.getEvents(april, None)
   >>> len(events)
   1
   >>> events[0].title
   "Martijn's Event"

It won't be in storage2::
   
   >>> storage2.getEvents(april, None)
   []

Now let's change the preferred storage of the storage manager::

  >>> m.setNewEventStorage('storage2')

And let's add another event::

  >>> event2 = lennart.createEvent(
  ...   datetime(2005, 4, 11, 16, 00),
  ...   timedelta(minutes=60),
  ...   title="Lennart's Event")
 
It should show up in storage2::

   >>> events = storage2.getEvents(april, None)
   >>> len(events)
   1
   >>> events[0].title
   "Lennart's Event"

And it won't be in storage1, which will still have a single
event::
  
   >>> events = storage1.getEvents(april, None)
   >>> len(events)
   1
