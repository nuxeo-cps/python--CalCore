New features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Calcore now sends events on event creation, deletion, status changes and
  other modifications. 
  PLEASE NOTE! Since most modifications is done directly on the events, 
  any system that uses calcore should definitely send EvenModifiedEvents
  whenever an event is modified! Calcore doesn't subscribe to any events
  itself, but systems that build on it, like CalZope, will.
- The on_invite and on_status_change mechanisms has been removed. They were
  primarily used to send notifications, and this is better done with events.
  They were also used to change the behaviour for attendees on invites.
  If you want to do this now, create a subscriber to the relevant events and
  do the modifications there. An exaple of this exists in 
  src/calcore/test/test_cal.py: test_inviteEvent().
Bug fixes:
~~~~~~~~~~
- #1708: no more 'NONE' attachement on import + export the document attribute
  as ATTACH value (in ical)
- make it possible to import event with both dtstart, dtend and duration
  (duration is recomputed to ensure consistency)
New internal features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Events now have an export method, and calendar.export call it instead of
  exporting things themselves. This is to allow easier overrides of both
  events and calendar exports.
